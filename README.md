## Overview
This work presents an interactive Tableau dashboard built to analyze ecommerce sales transactions and support data-driven insights across product, region, and time dimensions. 
The dataset represents ecommerce activity from January to August 2024 and is a sanitized, teaching-oriented dataset designed to simulate real-world analytics workflows used 
for KPI modeling and dashboard development. The project reflects common cloud data warehouse and analytics engineering practices, including conceptual data modeling aligned 
with Snowflake-style analytics layers and dbt-based transformation workflows. 

The dashboard enables monitoring of revenue and transaction performance, product and regional sales trends, payment method usage, and monthly growth patterns. 
This project was developed as part of my role as a Graduate Teaching Assistant (Data Analytics) at the University of Colorado Boulder to demonstrate practical dashboarding, 
KPI design, and data storytelling concepts.
